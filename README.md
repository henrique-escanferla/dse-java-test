# Java Developer Test – Final Submission (Java 17)

This repository contains my solutions to the Java Developer test, organized to map **1:1 with each question**
in the provided specification for clarity and ease of review.

## Approach Overview

My approach focused on **correctness, clarity, and maintainability**, rather than over-engineering.

For the Java coding task, I implemented a clean and well-tested solution using Java 17, with explicit
assumptions, complexity analysis, and unit tests to demonstrate robustness.

For design and theory questions, I emphasized **practical trade-offs, real-world constraints, and long-term
maintainability**, reflecting how these topics are applied in production systems. Security-related topics
are addressed using a **defense-in-depth mindset**, and testing strategies follow the **test pyramid**,
balancing confidence with execution cost.
